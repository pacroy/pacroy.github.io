# Exercise 1.3

What if we want to change some wordings:

- Multiples of three AND five, returns "Transfer"
- Multiples of three AND seven, returns "Thousand"
- Multiples of five AND seven, returns "Foresee"
- Multiples of three, five AND seven, returns "TFS"

Does your code has good maintainability? Can you change these words without touching existing codes?

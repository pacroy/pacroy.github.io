title: Exercise 2 Roman Numbers
description: In this exercise, the implementation of the logic is not so obvious like in the exercise 1. Please use TDD approach to write your code and tests that are easy to understand, change, and maintain. You will also apply data-driven testing technique in this exercise.

# Exercise 2.1

Do you know how to write Roman numbers? If you do, please write a method to convert an Arabic number (integer) in to Roman number (string). If you are not sure how to write Roman numbers, you may check Wikipedia or see this chart. Below table represents Roman symbols for numbers for your reference.

Please implement this method using TDD approach.

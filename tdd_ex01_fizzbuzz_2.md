# Exercise 1.2

What if we want to add more logics:

- Multiples of seven, returns "Wow"
- Multiples of three AND seven, returns "FizzWow"
- Multiples of five AND seven, returns "BuzzWow"
- Multiples of three, five AND seven, returns "FizzBuzzWow"

Here are some sample inputs/outputs:  
7 = Wow  
14 = Wow  
21 = FizzWow  
35 = BuzzWow  
105 = FizzBuzzWow  

Does your code has good maintainability? Can you add these logics without touching existing codes?
